## Chat server in node.js and socket.io

The main purpose of this project is to play with node.js and learn about it. Eventually, it may become usable, but for now is just a piece of software to me and others to play with.

I plan to implement:

- Rooms (done)
- Direct messages (done)
- Logging
- Registration
- Popup private windows
- Emoticons
- Blinking alerts in the title

To run the server execute 

`$ node server.js`

And then you can point your browser to `http://your_local_ip:1080`
You can customise the port in the constants of server.js. TODO: accept a parameter with the port
