## Chat server in node.js and socket.io

The main purpose of this project is to play with node.js and learn about it. Eventually, it may become usable, but for now is just a piece of software to me and others to play with.

To run the server execute
`node server

And then you can point your browser to `http://your_local_ip:1080`
